# Privacy Policy

## The Short Version

Doom Journal collects nothing. Your entries are yours.

## The Detailed Version

### Data Collection

**We collect nothing.** Zero. Zilch. Nada.

- No analytics
- No tracking pixels
- No usage metrics
- No error reporting
- No network requests whatsoever

### Data Storage

All your journal entries are stored locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not synced to any cloud service
- Is not accessible to us or anyone else
- Persists until you clear your browser data or uninstall the extension

### Network Activity

This extension makes **zero network requests**. You can verify this yourself:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Use the extension normally
4. Observe: nothing. No requests. Ever.

### Permissions

We request only the minimum permissions necessary:

- `webNavigation` — To detect when you're navigating to Twitter/X
- `storage` — To save your journal entries locally
- Host permissions for `twitter.com` and `x.com` — To intercept navigation to these sites

### Your Data, Your Control

- **Export anytime** — Download all your entries as Markdown or JSON
- **Delete anytime** — Uninstall the extension or clear browser data
- **No account required** — Nothing to sign up for, nothing to cancel

### Changes

If we ever change this policy (we won't), we'll update this document.
