# Doom Journal

Write before you scroll. A Chrome extension that asks you to journal for 1, 3, or 5 minutes before accessing Twitter/X.

**Free. Private. Persistent.**

No data ever leaves your browser. No accounts. No tracking. Export your journal anytime.

## How It Works

1. Try to visit Twitter or X
2. Get redirected to a calm, distraction-free writing page
3. Pick your duration (1, 3, or 5 minutes)
4. Write stream-of-consciousness — timer only counts down while you're typing
5. Once complete, you're redirected to Twitter with a 45-minute pass
6. Your entry is saved locally, always available to you
